      <h2>Plotting the Difference</h2>
      <p>A technique that I had not seen very often that Cairo introduces was to not just plot the raw numbers
      but plot the difference between an average or a given indix origin. This can
      emphasize changes, expecially seasonal changes or an actual trend.
      </p>
      <img src="difference.png" alt="">
      <p>This graph really highlights the effects of the Great Recession on the manufacturing industy
      in St. Louis. The plotting using a difference shows how drastic the change in production was.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="three">
    <h2>Plotting Ratios and Logs</h2>
    <p>
      The second technique that Cairo utlized was a log and ratio scale. This allowed
      the reader to undestand the bigger story to the data than what is presented by a
      by a different scale. Plotting ratios can show changes in the data that are not apparent otherwise.
      A logarithmic scale can show the rate of growth of populations that are exponential.
    </p>
    <img src="logarithmic.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Because there is such a wide gap in income, a logarithmic scale allows us to
    see how it is distributed in a smaller area. It is a technique that needs to
  be commented on, which it is in this case and it helps the data look connected.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="four">
      <h2>Experimental</h2>
      <p>Cairo ends with inspiration for the reader by introducing less common
        `types of visualization. Cairo seems to be saying how effective a unique and
        minimalistic visualization can be. He uses horizon charts as an example of showing changes
        in a very space efficient and beautiful way. He stresses how important typology, color, and
        composition are in visualizations.
      </p>
      <img src="Experimental.png" alt="">
      <p> I really like this graph because it is like a histogram but different.
        It shows the weight of people punching in at different times. I like how
        there is enough space to see the whole week in a small form factor.
