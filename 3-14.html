        Visualization is effective because of how people tend to view patterns
        before they make sense of the information. When information is visualized,
        the eye attempts to make meaning from it. Many people do not like very
        abstract art because they feel as if they need to find obvious substance
        to the visualization. Others find abstract visualizations rich with emotional
        substance. Our eyes look and try to find meaning at everything we see, which
        is why visualization is effective. We barely have to do any extra work
        understanding the information being presented if the visualization is good.

         There are a few important aspects of encoding data visually. The first is definitely
         what type of data you are trying to convey. Choosing the correct form
         to display the data is a good first step in creating a visualization.
         If the dataset elements are part of a whole, a graph with area might be
         easier for the eyes to generalize, while data that changes over time
         may not be so great. See images:
         <br><br>
         <img src="badpie.png" alt="">
         <img src="line.png" alt="">
         <br><br>
         It is very hard to decipher anything from the pie chart on first glance,
         and may be worse then describing how the data changes over time in words.
         The line chart does show how the data changes very easily over a period of time.
         <br><br>
         <img src="area.png" class='a' alt="">
         <br><br>
         The mapping, however, does show which years had the highest socks per capita.
         Cairo makes it clear that your choice is not clear until you try out
         different types of visualizations. Cairo stresses how different graphics
         complete different goals.

         The first trade off that Cairo explained was between details and a general picture.
         Sometimes visualizations have to choose between the two, and different
         choices for the form can strike a balance between the two. Sometimes,
         choosing baselines for the data can lead to confusion for the viewer, but
         a 0 baseline can sometimes lead to useless empty space. Cairo speaks
         about the conventions to many types of visualizations and how new uses
         can lead to great ones, but also speaks about the reality that viewers may
         not understand a visualization perfectly. There are tradeoffs to using a
         classic visual form versus a newer exciting one, becuase of the commonality
         of some and automatic associations with the old.
